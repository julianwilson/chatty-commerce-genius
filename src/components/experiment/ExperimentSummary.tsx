        The experiment revealed several standout winners, with Test A's 10% price reduction showing exceptional performance on the Lavender Dreams collection, achieving a 28% increase in conversion rate. The Rose Petals fragrance test variation also demonstrated strong results with a 15% uplift in average order value. However, Test B's 10% price increase notably underperformed, particularly on seasonal items, showing a 20% decrease in units sold. Overall, the winning variations contributed to a 15.8% improvement in performance metrics and generated an additional $45,000 in incremental revenue. Recommended action: Roll out the successful price optimizations across similar product categories while avoiding aggressive price increases on seasonal items.
